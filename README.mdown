# Lego Hogwarts Castle LED Lighting Controller

This is an Arduino sketch which implements a variety of simple LED animations which can run simultaneously.

Designed for my [Lego Hogwarts Castle lighting project](https://gloryfish..org/projects/lego-hogwarts-led-lighting-display). Check out that page for details about the hardware and for some pictures and video of it in action.
